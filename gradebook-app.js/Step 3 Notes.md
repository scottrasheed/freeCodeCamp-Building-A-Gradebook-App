🧪 What does Step 3 want?
You already have:
✅ a way to calculate average scores (getAverage)
✅ a way to turn a number score into a letter grade (getGrade)

Now the teacher wants to know:

Is the student passing?

We know from the description that anything that’s NOT an F is passing.
So if the letter grade is "F", they fail → return false.
Otherwise → return true.

🚦 How do we do it?
We already wrote a function called getGrade(score) that takes care of turning numbers into letters.
So you don’t need to write all those if/else checks again here — just call getGrade!

Here’s the logic spelled out:
1️⃣ Take the student’s numeric score (e.g., 87).
2️⃣ Use getGrade(87) → gives you "B".
3️⃣ Check: is that letter grade "F"?
  - Yes → return false
  - No → return true

🔷 Why not just check the number?
You could just check if (score >= 60) because 60+ is passing numerically, but the instructions say to use getGrade.
So you’re showing you know how to reuse functions you already wrote — which is a good coding skill!

Example walkthrough:
js
Copy
Edit
hasPassingGrade(100);
// calls getGrade(100) → returns "A++"
// "A++" !== "F" → returns true

hasPassingGrade(53);
// calls getGrade(53) → returns "F"
// "F" === "F" → returns false

hasPassingGrade(87);
// calls getGrade(87) → returns "B"
// "B" !== "F" → returns true
Why it’s good:
♻️ Reuses your existing function instead of duplicating logic.
📖 Easy to read: “if grade is not F → pass”.
🔍 Keeps your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

If you want, I can also write you an even more compact version and explain that too — let me know.
